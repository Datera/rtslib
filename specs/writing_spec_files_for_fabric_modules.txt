The /var/lib/target directory contains the spec files for
RisingTide Systems's LIO SCSI target subsystem fabric modules.

To support a new fabric module, a spec file should be installed containing
information for RTSLib to use it: SCSI Target features supported, WWN scheme,
kernel module information, etc.

Each spec file should be named MODULE.spec, where MODULE is the name the fabric
module is to be referred as. It contains a series of KEY = VALUE pairs, one per
line.

KEY is an alphanumeric (no spaces) string.
VALUE can be anything. Quotes can be used for strings, but are not mandatory.
Lists of VALUEs are comma-separated.

Syntax
------

* Strings
String values can either be enclosed in double quotes or not.
Those examples are equivalent:
kernel_module = "my_module"
kernel_module = my_module

* Lists
Lists are comma-separated lists of values. If you want to use a comma in a
string, use double quotes. Example:
my_string = value1, value2, "value3, with comma", value4

* Comments
All lines beginning with a pound sign (#) will be ignored.
Empty lines will be ignored too.

Available keys
--------------

* features
Lists the target fabric available features. Default value:
discovery_auth, acls, acls_auth, nps
exemple: features = discovery_auth, acls, acls_auth

Detail of features:

  * tpgts
  The target fabric module is using iSCSI-style target portal group tags.

  * discovery_auth
  The target fabric module supports a fabric-wide authentication for
  discovery.
  
  * acls
  The target's TPGTs do support explicit initiator ACLs.
  
  * acls_auth
  The target's TPGT's ACLs do support per-ACL initiator authentication.
  
  * nps
  The TPGTs do support iSCSI-like IPv4/IPv6 network portals, using IP:PORT
  group names.
  
  * nexus
  The TPGTs do have a 'nexus' attribute that contains the local initiator
  serial unit. This attribute must be set before being able to create any
  LUNs.
  
* wwn_type
Sets the type of WWN expected by the target fabric. Defaults to 'free'.
Example: wwn_type = iqn
Current valid types are:

  * free
  Freeform WWN.

  * iqn
  The fabric module targets are using iSCSI-type IQNs.

  * naa
  NAA SAS address type WWN.

  * unit_serial
  Disk-type unit serial.

* wwn_from_files
In some cases, and independently from the wwn type, the target WWNs must be
picked from a list of existing ones, the most obvious case being hardware-set
WWNs. Only the WWNs both matching the wwn_type (after filtering if set, see
below) and fetched from the specified files will be allowed for targets. The
value of this key is a list (one or more, comma-separated) of UNIX style
pathname patterns: * and ? wildcards can be used, and character ranges
expressed with [] will be correctly expanded.  Each file is assumed to contain
one or more WWNs, and line ends, spaces, tabs and null (\0) will be considered
as separators chars.
Example: wwn_from_files = /sys/class/fc_host/host[0-9]/port_name

* wwn_from_files_filter
Empty by default, this one allows specifying a shell command to which each WWN
from files will be fed, and the output of the filter will be used as the final
WWN to use. Examples:
wwn_from_files_filter = "sed -e s/0x// -e 's/../&:/g' -e s/:$//"
wwn_from_files_filter = "sed -e s/0x// -e 's/../&:/g' -e s/:$// | tr [a-z] [A-Z]"
The first example transforms strings like '0x21000024ff314c48' into
'21:00:00:24:ff:31:4c:48', the second one also shifts lower cases into upper
case, demonstrating that you can pipe as many commands you want into another.

* wwn_from_cmds
Same as wwn_from_files, but instead of taking a list of file patterns, takes a
list of shell commands. Each commands output will be considered as a list of
WWNs to be used, separated ny line ends, spaces, tabs and null (\0)
characters.

* wwn_from_cmds_filter
Same as wwn_from_files_filter, but filters/transforms the WWNs gotten from the
results of the wwn_from_cmds shell commands.

* kernel_module
Sets the name of the kernel module implementing the fabric modules. If not
specified, it will be assumed to be MODULE_target_mod, where MODNAME is the
name of the fabric module, as used to name the spec file. Note that you must
not specify any .ko or such extension here.
Example: kernel_module = my_module

* configfs_group
Sets the name of the configfs group used by the fabric module. Defaults to the
name of the module as used to name the spec file.
Example: configfs_group = iscsi
